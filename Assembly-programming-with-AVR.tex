\title{Cookbook for Assembly Programming with Arduino and plain 8bit Atmel AVR Micro Controllers}

\author{Felix Morgner and Manfred Morgner}


\maketitle

This book is ongoing work. If you find errors, typos, other mistakes, please get in touch with us. We are always happy to be shown better ways, clearer views, faster solutions, lesser errors ... you name it.

If you wish to follow our ways, it would be a good idea to get a copy of  ,ATMEL 8bit AVR instruction set manual':

\url{http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc0856.pdf}

In our book we will not explain the commands we are using because all explanation is already worded out in the named document. Clearly we will discuss why we are using specific commands if there are known (as in the context of the book) alternatives.

This book is mainly based on \at because we need to push aside micro controller model specifics. At some point we have to start to deal with this problem but we try to prevent this from happening as hard as we possibly can.

We are more destined to show what can be made and done with a small micro controller. It's clear for us, that more powerful platforms are available for a similar price. But our believe is, that learning Assembler Programming leaves deeper traces if the result of ones work is amazing in face of the used hardware, like a music instrument out of a micro controller some wire and some resistors.

This book is about Assembler Programming. We do not share the view that Assembler Programming will rescue the world. Each programming language has its purpose and some of them are useful too. The reader of this book wishes to learn Assembler Programming by example and has a tendency to experiment with the real thing. We try to satisfy this kind of reader by keeping the circuits simple and so price and requirements low.

\part{Simple Samples}

\chapter{Light}

In this chapter we will demonstrate the basics of assembly programming with AVR Micro Controllers. These samples will only require the simplest of additional hardware. If you use an Arduino, you will need only a simple wire for the first examples and the very first example nothings more than a powered Arduino.

\end{figure}

If not, you may build a circuit like in figure \ref{atmega8-basic-schema} on page \pageref{atmega8-basic-schema}. The breadboard layout is shown in file \texttt{LED/S000\_LED-Basic-Circuit.fz} in Fritzing file format.

As you may find out, we are focused on Free and Open Source Software. All published program code here is Free Software, the book itself and all used attachments are as free as we allowed to make them.

Also we will prevent usage of non free 'things' as hard as we can. We will not force anyone to use non free products to follow our ways. On of our main goals is an intellectual contribution to the world of Free Thinking, Libre Software and cooperative work.
