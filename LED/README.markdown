# LED Examples

## Let there be light!

The simplest program doing something: Set a LED under power.

We use Arduino Pin 13, which is PORTB/BIT5 on the MC chip. After starting the programm the LED on Arduino Pin 13 lights up.

If you decide to use the plain MC you need to connect you resistor and LED to pin 19 of your MC chip (PB5).

## Light on, light off

The next stage: Switching the LED on and off by a button.
