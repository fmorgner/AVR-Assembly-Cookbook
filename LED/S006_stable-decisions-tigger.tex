\section{Stable Decisions Triggered}

If you feel a bit uncertain about our solution or if you have the feeling that all this should be done better you may be right. We would not ensure you that the following solution is better under every circumstance, but for some application, there is a much better way.

For this way we need to introduce the concept of interrupts.

The magic behind interrupts in micro controllers is much more as in simple CPUs!

Interrupts are special mechanics in processing units to enable the execution of code at a certain time or after a certain event by interrupting the normal processing, doing something else and after this continue whatever was interrupted.

In micro processors this mechanic is much more sophisticated. In micro controllers you may interrupt the system from nothing! Meaning, it is possible to nearly shut off the whole system, interrupt it from his deep sleep, let it do something and send it back to sleep again.

Such applications are useful if energy resources are small. For example, if you wish to drive your weather station one year on a single AAA cell or less, possibly supported by solar power.

In such applications you wish to reduce power consumption of your system as far as possible. There is no need to let your micro controller do eight million cycles per second if you take a measurement every ten minutes! It may be much better so stop the whole system until the next measurement is to start.

You already may expect it. Such code does not need to loop with full processing power to do nothing, such code really does nothing while waiting:

\begin{lstlisting}
; LED/S005_stable-decisions-trigger.asm

.DEVICE atmega8

.org 0x0000
            rjmp    start
            rjmp    trigger0
            
start:
            ...
            
main:
            sleep
            rjmp    main

trigger0:
            do_it
            reti
\end{lstlisting}

This approach also has the advantage to don't need the otherwise necessary status accumulator register and consequently no comparison between former and current status. It simple needs to change the current status of the light if called.
