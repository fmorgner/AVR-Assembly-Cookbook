# Tutorial for AVR assembly programming

To build the book (in both languages) run './book-make.sh' from the project directory.

This is a joined effort to provide the community with a guide to nice and clean AVR assembly programming.
Please note that it is in a very early development stage.

## Shift registers

  - shift sram: move it as fast as you can

## LED

  - let there be light: simplest program of all
  - get me on get me off: toggle your lights
  - stable decisions: switch the lights
  - stable decisions + symbols: program like prosa

## Coming soon

  - rest in peace: deeper sleeping
  - take a seat: long time timers
  - take 2: the two wire interface
