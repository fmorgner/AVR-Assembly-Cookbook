\section{SRAM to Shift Register}

Sending SRAM content/data to shift registers has some applications. Some of them are

\begin{itemize}
  \item {Light chains}
  \item {Raster displays}
\end{itemize}

It is an important way to communicate with the technical environment in certain situations. Most importantly if you have more bit to output as pins on your micro controller.
